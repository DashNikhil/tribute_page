            "Don't take rest after your first victory because if you fail in the second, more lips are waiting to say
            that your first victory was just luck."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."
        </p>
        <p>"You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean
            does not become dirty." </p>
        <p>"All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents."</p>
        <p>"Thinking is the capital, an enterprise is the way, and hard work is the solution."</p>
        <p>"Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough."</p>
        <p>"It's very easy to defeat someone, but it's very hard to win someone."</p>
        <p>"Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success."</p>
        <p>"We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us."</p>
        <p>"Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow."</p>
        <p>"You see, God helps only people who work hard. That principle is very clear."</p>
        <p>"You have to dream before your dreams can come true."</p>
        <p>"If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun." </p>
        <p>"Great dreams of great dreamers are always transcended."</p>
